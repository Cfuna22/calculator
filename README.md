# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator  

This is a simple Python program that takes two numbers and a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /) from the user, then performs the calculation and displays the result.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
✅ Handles division by zero with an error message  
✅ Uses formatted output for clean results  

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. Check with:  
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```
2. Clone this repository or copy the `calculator.py` file.  

## ▶️ Usage  
Run the script in a terminal:  
```sh
python3 calculator.py
```
Then, enter:  
1️⃣ First number  
2️⃣ Second number  
3️⃣ Operator (+, -, *, /)  

### Example:  
```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +  
10 + 5 = 15  
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling  
- If the user enters `/` and the second number is `0`, it will display an **error message** instead of crashing.  
- If the user enters an **invalid operator**, it will prompt them to enter a valid one.  

## 🎯 To-Do  
🔹 Add exponentiation (^) and modulus (%) operations  
🔹 Create a graphical interface (GUI) version  
🔹 Convert it into a web-based calculator
